Description:
"Who Wants to Be a Java Programmer?" is a Java-based multiple-choice quiz game designed to test knowledge of Java programming concepts. The game features 10 questions, each with four answer choices, and tracks the user's score. High scores are stored and compared with the user's performance, and the game offers options to view rules, take the test, or exit the program.

Features:
Main Menu:

View the rules of the game.
Start the test.
Exit the game.
Quiz Questions:

The game reads 10 Java-related multiple-choice questions from a file.
Each question has four answer options (A, B, C, D).
Players can answer the questions, and their score is updated based on correct answers.
High Score Management:

The game tracks high scores and compares them with the user's performance.
If the user achieves a new high score, they can input their name, and the high score table is updated.
High scores are saved in a text file (highscore.txt).
Error Handling:

If the question file is not found or cannot be read, the game displays an error message and gracefully exits the quiz.
User Interaction:

The game uses JOptionPane for graphical dialog boxes to display menus, questions, and results.
